**Basics** <br>
Principle - First In First Out (FIFO) <br>

Basic Terminologies - Front, Rear and Size. Capacity - the maximum number of elements the queue can hold. <br>
Types - <br>1. Simple Queue - FIFO, insertion only at Rear, Deletion only from Front. Can be implemented using Arrays and Linked List<br> 2. Double ended Queue aka Deque - Insertion and deletion can be performed from both ends. <br> 3. Priority Queue - A queue where each element is assigned a priority, and deletion always happens based on priority (not just position). <br>

Common Operations - Enqueue, Dequeue, Peek/Front, Size, isEmpty, isFull <br>
**How to perform in Java?**<br>
q.add(x), q.poll(), q.peek(), q.isEmpty(), q.size() <br><br>

Implementation can be done using Simple Array, Circular Array and LinkedList.<br><br>

For each folder or files, check only the .java file and not .class for code implementation/solution.
